# MarketTools
Java tools for processing market and economic data.

This set of tools reads many years in Stock Investor Pro data and converts to a common DB format.

This DB can be read back into memory to be used generating reports on the fundamental data.

I work on the code using Eclipse. But feel free to create your own environment and uploaded the configuration files and Readme here.

A couple tools find useful to work with this github repository:

A work in progress. Constant updates...
